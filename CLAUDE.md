# CarbonRag Claude/Codex Instructions

## OpenSpec First

Before implementing non-trivial changes, read `AGENTS.md`, the relevant `openspec/specs/**`, and the active `openspec/changes/<change-id>/**`.

OpenSpec defines what to build and why. GitNexus provides code intelligence and impact analysis. Do not treat GitNexus as a replacement for OpenSpec or human review.

## GitNexus First For Code Impact

Before modifying backend, frontend, carbon, RAG, session, report, auth, deployment, or cross-module code:

1. Verify `openspec validate --all`.
2. Verify `gitnexus status`.
3. Use GitNexus context/query/impact/detect_changes before changing code.
4. Report high-risk blast radius before implementation.

## Mattermost Coordination

Before non-trivial edits, read recent Mattermost `carbonrag-control` messages and post a structured PLAN when Mattermost is available.

For API, DB, auth, deployment, model provider, carbon engine, RAG core, or cross-module edits, wait for #1 ACK before implementation.

Respect LOCK, BLOCK, and DECISION messages. Post CHANGED after meaningful milestones and REVIEW_READY before PR.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **CarbonRag** (13108 symbols, 26652 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
